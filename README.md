### HOW TO USE:

1.  Fill out the survey with your name, a URL link to a profile picture, and your answers to all 10 questions.

2.  Submit your answers. A modal will appear showing you the name and profile picture of the most compatible friend.  This friend is found by checking all other Friends in the database.  The difference between each of your answers  with each of the friends' results in a total difference for each friend.  The friend with the lowest total difference will be calculated as the most compatible with you. 

3. You can click on the Friends List link at the bottom of each page to see a JSON of all the friends in the database. Once you've submitted your information, an object containing your information is also added in.
